                        <p>
                            I have recently become more interested in web development and wanted to deepen my knowledge. After building this website, I decided to explore different technologies and frameworks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of my previous projects involved using Django to create a better portfolio website for myself. This led me to further experiment and learn about Next.js.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I'm developing a successor to the Commandline UI for a Library Database that I initially built during my first year of studies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this project, I am using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. I haven't implemented a database yet, but I plan to do so in the future.
                        </p>

                            This project was done by me and my co-student at TalTech. 
                            It was developed during the first year of university so it isn't too advanced.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            For this project we used C and MySQL for the database. 
                            I mainly worked on the code aspect of the program but also learned a lot about how a database works from my co-student.

                        <p>
                            It is purely hardware-based and uses frequency filters to control LEDs based on audio input.
                            The LEDs are controlled by an Arduino Nano board and the frequency filters are made using capacitors and resistors.

                        <p>I worked with and tested different programming languages and microcontrollers to find the best combination for the purpose of the device.</p>
