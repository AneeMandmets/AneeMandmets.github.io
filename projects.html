                            This project was done by me and my co-student at TalTech. 
                            It was developed during the first year of university so it isn't too advanced.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            For this project we used C and MySQL for the database. 
                            I mainly worked on the code aspect of the program but also learned a lot about how a database works from my co-student.

                        <p>This is also a team project and was developed during my second year studies.</p>
                        <p>
                            It is purely hardware-based and uses frequency filters to control LEDs based on audio input.
                            The LEDs are controlled by an Arduino Nano board and the frequency filters are made using capacitors and resistors.
