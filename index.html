            <h2>Color Music Project</h2>
            <p>This project involved creating a fully hardware-based audio reactive lighting system.  The goal was to design a circuit that could filter incoming audio frequencies from an auxiliary input and use these filtered signals to control the on/off state of multiple LEDs.  This was achieved using an Arduino Nano microcontroller and three operational amplifier (op-amp) based filters to isolate specific frequency ranges. Each filter's output controlled a separate group of LEDs, resulting in a dynamic lighting display synchronized to the music's frequency content.  The project successfully demonstrated the application of analog signal processing techniques in a creative and visually engaging way.  Overcoming challenges such as precise frequency filtering and LED control timing, the project highlights the practical application of hardware and software integration in a real-world application.</p>
